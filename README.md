Welcome to the MIDOG github repository. Here you can find code of our own evaluations and a dockered reference algorithm for mitotic figures to use as a template.

The folder [DomainShiftQuantization](https://github.com/DeepPathology/MIDOG/tree/main/DomainShiftQuantification) contains code of our MIDL paper [Quantifying the Scanner-Induced Domain Gap in Mitosis Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.16515.pdf).

The folder gc-midog-docker-reference contains a reference docker container with a baseline algorithm for the MIDOG challenge.
